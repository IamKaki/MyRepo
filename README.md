This is a repo to learn C on my own using Harry's Youtube chanel.
This is another attempt to understand programming and I choose C.
I beleive that if I can learn and understand C I will have a solid foundation as new programmer.
I honestly do not know what the future holds, but I do know I will be a great programmer with time and a lot of effort.
I have just quit ALX because the course is too fast for me to properly grasp the concepts, but I have not given up on programming even by 1%.
Through the help of Harry and then Jane, I must and I will learn programming to the core.
Good luck to me and to everyone else on this journey with me.
